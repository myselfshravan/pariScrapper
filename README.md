### **Summary on Betting Odds & Arbitrage**

1. **Understanding Betting Odds**
    - Odds represent the potential return on a bet.
    - **Example:** India (1.14), Australia (5.60).
    - Formula: **Payout = Bet Amount × Odds**.
    - Betting ₹200 on India at **1.14** returns ₹228 (₹28 profit if they win).
    - Betting ₹200 on Australia at **5.60** returns ₹1120 (₹920 profit if they win).


2. **Can You Bet on Both Teams and Always Win?**
    - This is called **arbitrage betting** (guaranteed profit regardless of the result).
    - It works if:
    - \[
      \frac{1}{\text{India Odds}} + \frac{1}{\text{Australia Odds}} < 1
      \]
    - If the condition is met, we can calculate the exact amounts to a bet on each team to ensure profit.
    - Example: With **1.14 & 15.60 odds**, you could bet ₹186.38 on India and ₹13.62 on Australia to guarantee **₹198.85
      profit**.


3. **How Are Betting Odds Set by Bookmakers?**
    - Odds are based on **implied probability**:  
      \[
      \text{Probability} = \frac{1}{\text{Odds}}
      \]
    - For **1.14 (India):** 87.72% probability
    - For **5.60 (Australia):** 17.86% probability
    - Total: **105.58%** (extra 5.58% is the bookmaker’s profit margin).
    - Bookmakers adjust odds based on market demand, betting patterns, and team conditions to ensure they always profit.


4. **Why Are Some Bets Always Profitable?**
    - **Rare cases** occur when bookmakers miscalculate odds, or betting shifts cause discrepancies.
    - Arbitrage opportunities arise when the sum of inverse odds is **less than 1**, allowing bettors to lock in
      guaranteed profit.

### **Conclusion**

- Betting odds include **bookmaker margins** to ensure they profit.
- **Arbitrage betting** is a way to guarantee profit by betting on both sides **if odds are favorable**.
- You can calculate the exact bets required for risk-free profit **only in certain situations**.
